# Analysis so far:

Here's what the data reveals:

## **Ferrari's Optimal Performance Conditions**

### **Best Temperature Range: 30.0-33.3°C**
- **MAE: 0.2253 sec/lap** (lowest prediction error)
- **Sample size: 16 stints**
- **Why this matters**: This extremely low prediction error indicates Ferrari has very **consistent and predictable tire degradation** in these conditions

### **Second Best: 22.9-24.8°C** 
- **MAE: 0.5329 sec/lap**
- **R² = -0.002** (near zero, meaning reasonable predictability)
- **Sample size: 16 stints**

## **Track Types Where Ferrari Excels**

### **Warm Weather Circuits (30-33°C)**
These conditions likely correspond to tracks like:
- **Bahrain GP** (March/April)
- **Miami GP** (May)
- **Spanish GP** (June)
- **Hungarian GP** (July)

### **Moderate Climate Tracks (23-25°C)**
Likely includes:
- **Silverstone** (July)
- **Spa-Francorchamps** (August)
- **Monza** (September)

## **Why Ferrari Performs Best in These Conditions**

### **1. Temperature-Stint Interaction Mastery**
- **Top feature importance: 0.4028** for temperature-stint interaction
- Ferrari has optimized their tire management for warm conditions
- Their car setup and driving style work harmoniously with tire behavior in this range

### **2. Medium Compound Advantage**
- **Medium tires: MAE = 0.4282** (best compound performance)
- **26-27 stints analyzed** (good data confidence)
- Ferrari's car characteristics suit medium compound degradation patterns

### **3. Predictable Strategy Windows**
- Low prediction error means Ferrari can plan pit stops with high confidence
- Consistent degradation allows for aggressive or conservative strategies as needed

## **Where Ferrari Struggles**

### **Cold Conditions (15.7-19.2°C)**
- **MAE: 1.7396 sec/lap** (highest error)
- **R² = -1.013** (very poor predictability)
- Likely tracks: **Imola** (early season), **Silverstone** (if cold), **Netherlands**

### **Soft Compound Performance**
- **MAE: 2.5945 sec/lap** (worst compound)
- **Only 7 stints analyzed** (limited data)
- Ferrari struggles with soft tire management

## **Strategic Implications**

### **Target Races for Ferrari**
1. **Bahrain** - Warm, consistent conditions
2. **Miami** - Similar temperature profile
3. **Spain** - Moderate degradation, good for strategy
4. **Hungary** - Warm weather, overtaking difficult (tire strategy crucial)

### **Challenging Races**
1. **Early season European races** (cold conditions)
2. **Races requiring soft tire performance**
3. **Tracks with high temperature variation**

## **Key Takeaway**

Ferrari's tire degradation is **most predictable and manageable** in warm conditions (30-33°C) with medium compounds. This suggests their 2025 car setup, aerodynamic balance, and driver technique (Hamilton & Leclerc) are optimized for these conditions.

The **0.2253 sec/lap prediction error** in optimal conditions means Ferrari can plan pit stops with exceptional precision, giving them a significant strategic advantage at warm-weather circuits.

**Bottom line**: Ferrari should be strongest at **warm-weather tracks** like Bahrain, Miami, Spain, and Hungary, where their tire management consistency translates to strategic advantages.
